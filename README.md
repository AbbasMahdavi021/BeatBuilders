# CSC600 Final Project - Instrument App

Welcome to the CSC600 Final Project repository! This project is a collaborative effort by a group of students for the completion of the CSC600 course. The goal of this project is to create an instrument app with each group member contributing different instruments and a visualizer for the instruments.


## Features

    Instrument Creation: Each group member has created a unique instrument for the app. Instruments include various musical instruments, synthesizers, or experimental sound generators.

    Visualizer: The app features a visualizer component that responds to the sounds produced by the instruments. The visualizer enhances the user experience and provides a visually captivating element to the app.

    Frontend Technologies: The frontend of the application is developed using Typescript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development.

    Backend Technology: The app utilizes SQL as the database management system to store notes, sounds, and songs associated with the instruments.

## Importance of the Project

Group Work: 
The CSC600 Final Project provides an opportunity for students to collaborate effectively as a group. Working together on a complex project allows for the development of teamwork and communication skills, which are essential in real-world software development scenarios.

TypeScript Proficiency: 
The use of TypeScript in the frontend development of the instrument app showcases the students' ability to work with a statically-typed language and leverage its benefits. TypeScript adds an extra layer of type safety, enabling better code quality and reducing potential runtime errors.

Full-Stack Development: 
The project combines frontend technologies such as TypeScript and Tailwind CSS with backend technologies like SQL, creating a full-stack development experience. This allows students to gain insights into both the client-side and server-side aspects of web application development.

Application of Database Concepts: 
The utilization of SQL as the backend database management system provides an opportunity for students to apply their knowledge of database concepts. They will learn how to design and interact with a database to store and retrieve data related to notes, sounds, and songs associated with the instruments.

Real-World Relevance: 
Building an instrument app mimics real-world scenarios where developers create interactive applications with rich user experiences. This project helps students understand the practical aspects of developing web applications that engage users through multimedia elements and database interactions.
